//we need to build a new curve for ai agent.
//curve will be spr/aiagent and will collect revenue as spr/aiagent
//first we need to figure out the curve. we will start by writing the tests for the curve and present it. it's better if it's adjustable
//after curve is built, we will make sure buy sell functions are working properly.

//than we move on to the revenue collector and factory contracts and make sure they are compatiable with the new curve.

//after buy sell we make sure dex migration is valid and working properly.

//we keep testing the curve and make sure it's working properly.

//we handle subgraph.
